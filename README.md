Scenario

Client is building a page-based site to display large publications broken into a single URL per page.

As part of this, they need to be able to generate page numbers.

Their numbering scheme dictates that prefaces are numbered using roman numerals in upper case and appendices are numbered using roman numerals in lower case.

A colleague has made a start by writing test cases for the upper-case generation.
